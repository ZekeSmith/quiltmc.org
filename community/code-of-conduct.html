        <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

        <p>Like many communities, our policies are based on a Code of Conduct. Please make sure you read it before making use of
our spaces, as it provides a set of behavioural guidelines that we expect everyone to adhere to.</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<p>This Code of Conduct applies to anyone that makes use of a space managed by the Quilt team. <strong>Not having read the Code 
of Conduct is not a valid excuse for breaking it,</strong> and all members of the community will be held to this standard.</p>

<p>While we try to go into detail with our examples, it’s impossible to cover every possible situation in one document. In
general, treat others how you wish to be treated - if you wouldn’t like to be treated in a particular way, don’t treat
others like that either!</p>

<p>This Code of Conduct is the basis for <a href="/community/">our rules</a>. We require that all community 
members read both this document, and the rules document.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="our-pledge">Our Pledge</h2>

<p>We as community members, contributors, and team members pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of age, culture, ethnicity, gender identity &amp; expression, nationality, physical or
mental disabilities or differences (regardless of intensity), politics, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation,
socio-economic status or subcultural affiliation.</p>

<p>We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community,
and we are committed to promoting these concepts.</p>

<h2 id="our-standards">Our Standards</h2>

<p>We expect the members of our community to participate in a positive, authentic and deliberate way. Consideration,
respect and empathy are key when it comes to building and supporting a healthy community, and we request that our
members exercise this through their actions.</p>

<p>Please take into account that online communities bring people together from many different cultures and backgrounds.
It’s important to understand that sometimes the combination of cultural differences and online interaction can lead to
misunderstandings.</p>

<p>Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Demonstrating empathy, patience and kindness toward other people</li>
  <li>Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences</li>
  <li>Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback</li>
  <li>Respecting others’ personal choices, even when they don’t line up with yours</li>
  <li>Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience</li>
  <li>Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of unacceptable behavior include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind</li>
  <li>Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments</li>
  <li>Personal or political attacks</li>
  <li>Threats of violence, or violent acts towards others</li>
  <li>Public or private harassment</li>
  <li>Intentionally dead-naming or misgendering others</li>
  <li>Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
(“doxxing”)</li>
  <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any unacceptable forms of behaviour</li>
  <li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="enforcement-responsibilities">Enforcement Responsibilities</h2>

<p>Community team members are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take
appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.</p>

<p>If a community member engages in behavior violating this Code of Conduct, the members of the community team may take
any action they deem appropriate. Actions may range from a simple warning to the most drastic: permanent removal from
the community, exclusion from any interaction, and loss of all rights in the community.</p>

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

<p>This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces (both online and offline), as well as when an individual
is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an
official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an
online or offline event.</p>

<p>This Code of Conduct applies to all projects, repositories and community spaces that are managed by Quilt, regardless 
of whether or not the use of this code is explicitly called out. We also reserve the right to retroactively enforce 
this Code of Conduct when community members violate it in spaces not managed by Quilt.</p>

<h2 id="reporting-a-problem">Reporting a Problem</h2>

<p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the Quilt community team 
directly on Discord. If your report concerns a specific community team member or group of community team members, 
please send your report to a team member that is not part of the report, or a member of the administrative board.</p>

<p>All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, and all team members are obligated to respect the
privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.</p>

<h2 id="changes--feedback">Changes &amp; Feedback</h2>

<p>It is likely that this Code of Conduct will need additions, modifications and other improvements. Online culture
changes, new views and sensitivities emerge which need to be taken into account. To that end, we reserve the right to
update this Code of Conduct at any time, pending feedback from the community when possible.</p>

<p>We always welcome feedback and suggestions. If you’d like to provide either, feel free to
<a href="https://github.com/QuiltMC/quiltmc.orgissues">open an issue on GitHub</a>!</p>
